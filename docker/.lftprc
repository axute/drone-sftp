# The commands in string are executed before lftp exits.
set cmd:at-exit "bye"

# enables csh-like history expansion.
set cmd:csh-history no

#The value is used when 'open' is used with just host name without protocol. Default is 'ftp'.
set cmd:default-protocol ftp

# if true, exit when an unconditional (without || and && at begin) command fails.
set cmd:fail-exit no

# time of command execution, which is considered as 'long' and a beep is done before next prompt. 0 means off.
set cmd:long-running 1

# default ls argument
set cmd:ls-default "ls -lh"

# when false, lftp refuses to go to background when exiting. To force it, use 'exit bg'.

# query for SRV records and use them before gethostbyname. The SRV records are only used if port is not explicitly
# specified. See RFC2052 for details.

# enable DNS cache. If it is off, lftp resolves host name each time it reconnects.
set dns:cache-enable yes

# expiration, set it to 'inf' or 'never'.

# name. Set to 'never' to disable.
set dns:fatal-timeout 10

# if true, lftp will fork before resolving host address. Default is true.
set dns:use-fork yes

# set net:reconnect-interval-multiplier (real number)
